# GDMENU Card Manager
Manage content on SD Card for Dreamcast's GDEmu/GDMenu

For GDEMU to propperly work it's required to follow a pattern when putting files on the SD Card.<br/>
If not done correctly it will take a lot of time to boot and can even fail to.<br/>
This program will save the files the proper way so you console will boot super fast!

### GDI Shrinking
Can reduce the size of the game but some games won't work propperly.

The program have a blacklist with some games known to have problems after shrinking.

By default the blacklist will be used and those games will not be shrinked.

### Windows version requires the .Net 5 Desktop Runtime
Donwload and install the [Desktop Runtime installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) for your system.

On Linux version it's not possible to use drag-and-drop.

**If you can't run it on OSX please check issue #4 for a workaround**
